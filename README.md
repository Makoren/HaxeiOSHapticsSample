# Haxe iOS Haptics Sample
A very simple Haxe implementation of iOS haptics. This doesn't use a single line of Swift or Objective-C code, it's all done through Haxe externs.

This sample uses OpenFL, but the extern code has no dependencies and will likely work in other libraries like Kha or Ceramic.

I used [hx-ios-uikit](https://github.com/rainyt/hx-ios-uikit) as a reference for this, that repository has lots of great info on how to use iOS APIs.
